'''assert is a keyword used to test if a given condition is true.
It helps in debugging by allowing you to check assumptions in your code.
If the condition evaluates to True, the program continues executing. 
If the condition evaluates to False, an AssertionError is raised, stopping the program and optionally displaying an error message.'''

# Syntax :  assert condition, optional_message

x = 10
assert x > 5, "x should be greater than 5"  # This will pass since 10 > 5

y = 3
assert y > 5, "y is not greater than 5"     # This will raise an AssertionError with the message


#output:

#AssertionError: y is not greater than 5

'''Use Cases of assert:

Debugging:   It is commonly used during development to check conditions that should never happen (e.g., input validation).

Ensuring invariants:   You can ensure certain conditions remain true throughout the execution of the program (e.g., checking the validity of algorithm steps).'''

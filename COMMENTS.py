#       COMMENTS IN PYTHON

#---used to explain python code-- increase readablity--prevent execution when testing code.
#---the lines in the comment wont occupy any space/memory--not read by interpreter.

#CREATING A COMMENT

    #1.we use " # " symbol
print("above this line i have written command can you see that..")

    #2. we can even place at the end of the code line
    
print("i have comment at the end of this..can you see it ")

#MULTILINE COMMENTS:

    #we can have " # " /" # en-number of times"--to write multiple line comment.

    ######this is one the multiline command
    ## as i have muliple command written one after the other.

print("i have writeen a multiple line commend above this")

"""this is an other way of writting multiple line of commends
 but here we cannot give the space before this commend which we can give in '#' type of commend """

print("i have multiple line of commend before this line can you see that commends in the interpreter")
